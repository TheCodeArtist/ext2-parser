<h3><a name="overview">Project overview</a></h3>

In this project, you'll finish the implementation of a program that
understands the on-disk format of a Linux "ext2" filesystem walks
through its directory hierarchy to read some files. We've provided
most of the code for you, but we have omitted the implementation of
some key functions.  Your job is to fill in the omitted code.
<p>

To help you know whether or not your code is correct, we've provided
you with a bunch of test code that examine the data structures and
file content retrieved by your code, and compares them to the
known-to-be-correct values. Once your code passes all of our tests,
you're done! If your code fails some of our tests, you can look at the
tests and the expected values they print out, to help you diagnose
your errors.
</p><p>

There is a fair amount of code in the program, but you'll only need to
write on the order of 80 new lines of code to finish the
implementation. Of course, getting the right 80 lines isn't trivial.
But, we've provided detailed step-by-step comments within the code
itself telling you what you need to accomplish each step of the way.
</p><p>

There are two high-level phases to this project:
</p><ol>
 <li> Learn about the on-disk format of ext2.
 </li><li> Dive into the code and finish our implementation.
</li></ol>

Once you've passed these phases, you're ready to turn in your final
implementation.

<h3><a name="ext2">Understanding ext2</a></h3>

In this section of the project web page, we'll give you a good enough
understanding of the ext2 filesystem to finish the project.  If you're
curious for more information, there are several books and web pages
that discuss the ext2 file system in gory detail; for example, see see
chatper 9.1 of <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/451/01wi/TLKCopy/tlk.html">The
Linux Kernel</a>, or chapter 17 of <a href="http://wiki.nectec.or.th/ngiwiki/bin/viewfile/Main/Kritsana_Deliverable?rev=1;filename=OReilly_Understanding_The_Linux_Kernel.pdf">Understanding
the Linux Kernel</a>.  <p>

ext2 (the "second extended filesystem") has a data structure and
on-disk layout that is similar to FFS, which we covered in class.
Here's a picture describing ext2's on-disk layout:
<br><br>
</p><center>
<img src="project3_light_files/ext2.png" height="282/" width="536">
</center>
<br clear="all"><br>

At one level, an ext2 filesystem is just a series of blocks on disk,
starting with block 0 and ending with block N, where N = (disk_size /
block_size) - 1. The block size of an ext2 filesystem is a parameter
chosen when the filesystem is formatted: you shouldn't assume any
particular blocksize, though in practice you'll typically encounter
1024 byte or 4096 byte block sizes. So, if you need to fetch block 5
off of the disk, you'd fetch <i>blocksize</i> bytes starting from
offset <i>5*blocksize</i> on disk. <p>

At a different level, ext2 splits the disk into an initial boot block
that the BIOS of the computer fetches and executes during the boot
process, followed by a series of "block groups." A block group is a
lot like a cylinder group that we discussed in class: it's a set of
adjacent blocks.  Blocks within the same block group tend to be
spatially close to each other on the disk, and therefore quick to seek
between.  Blocks in different block groups might be very far apart. In
ext2, each block group has a fixed size, selected at the time the
filesystem is formatted.
</p><p>

Each block group is split into a set of sections:

</p><ul>

  <li> the <b>superblock</b> is the first block within each block group.
  It contains a bunch of metadata describing the file system, such as
  the block size, the number of blocks in a block group, and other
  information. Each block group in an ext2 filesystem contains a copy
  of the superblock.  (Note that in later revisions of ext2, fewer
  copies of the superblock were made, but for this project you can
  assume the superblock exists as the first block of every block
  group.)
  <p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>group descriptor table</b> occupies some integral number
  of blocks following the superblock.  The group descriptor table
  contains one descriptor entry for each block group in the
  filesystem. A descriptor entry describes various things about its
  associated block group, including the block number at which its
  inode table begins.  Descriptor entry 0 refers to block group 0,
  descriptor entry 1 to block group 1, and so on.
  <p>
  If there are N block groups in the file system, there will be N
  group descriptors entries in the group descriptor table.  Since a
  group descriptor has a known size (32 bytes), you can use the
  information in the superblock to calculate how many block groups
  there are, and therefore how many group descriptors there are, and
  therefore how many blocks the group descriptor table occupies.
  </p><p>
  Each block group in the file system contains a full copy of the
  group descriptor table.
  </p><p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>data block bitmap</b> is a bitmap that indicates which
  of the data blocks within this block group have been allocated, and
  which are free for allocation.  You won't be accessing or using this
  bitmap in this project.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>inode bitmap</b> is a bitmap that indicates which of the
  inodes within this block group have been allocated, and which are
  free for allocation.  You won't be accessing or using this bitmap in
  this project.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>inode table</b> is an array of inodes.  Each inode
  occupies 128 bytes.  The structure of an inode is roughly what we
  covered in class; you'll dig into the details during your
  implementation.  An inode of a file contains the file's type
  (e.g., directory vs. regular file), the size of the file's data,
  pointers to direct data blocks, a singly indirect block, a doubly
  indirect block, and a triply indirect block.
  <p>
  The superblock tells you how many inodes there are in a block group,
  and given this, you can calculate how many blocks the inode table
  occupies.
  </p><p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>data blocks</b> section is an array of data blocks used
  to store files' content.
  <p>
</p></li></ul>

<h4>Directories</h4>

In ext2, a directory is just a file that happens to contain specially
formatted data. A directory file contains a linked list of
variable-sized directory entries. Each entry in the directory contains
an inode number for that entry, a filename for the entry, and an
offset to the next entry in the linked list. So, by reading the
contents of a directory file, you can find out the names of files
within that directory, as well as the inode numbers for those
files. Note that every directory contains two special entries, one for
the "." file (the current directory), and one for the ".." file (the
parent directory).
<p>

For detailed information about what a directory file looks like in
ext2, look at <a href="http://linux-security.com.cn/ebooks/ulk3-html/0596005652/understandlk-CHP-18-SECT-2.html#understandlk-CHP-18-FIG-3">figure
13 on this external page</a>.
</p><p>

There are two details you may encounter.  First, when a file is
deleted from a directory, it's possible that the directory file itself
is not repacked to fill the gap, but rather a "hole" gets created in
the directory file where the deleted file's directory entry used to
live, and the linked list structure will jump over the hole.  Second,
the linked list structure is terminated with a directory entry
containing inode number 0: this is an indicator that this is a
terminating entry (kind of like a NULL terminator in a string), rather
than a valid file in the directory.

</p><h4>Inodes</h4>

An inode in EXT2 is 128 bytes long, and contains many different
fields.  For this project, we only care about a few of them:

<ul>
  <li> the <b>i_size</b> field indicates the number of bytes stored
  in the file, i.e., the file's length.
  <p>

  </p></li><li> the <b>i_block</b> array is an array of 15 block numbers.
  <ul>
   <li> The first 12 entries in the array (i_block[0] through
    i_block[11]) contain the block numbers of direct blocks:  they
    name data blocks that contain the first 12 blocks worth of the
    file's content.<p>

    </p></li><li> The 13th entry in the array (i_block[12]) contains the block
    number of a singly indirect block:  it names a block that contains
    an array of 4 byte block numbers; each of these blocks contains
    additional file contents.<p>

    </p></li><li> The 14th entry in the array (i_block[13]) contains the block
    number of a doubly indirect block:  it names a block that contains
    an array of 4-byte block numbers, each of these blocks in a singly
    indirect block, that contains an array of 4-byte block numbers of
    direct blocks.<p>

    </p></li><li> The 15th entry in the array (i_block[14]) contains the block
    number of a triple indirection block.<p>
  </p></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h4>Summary</h4>

This is basically everything you need to understand about how
EXT2 lays out its data on disk.  Let's dive into the implementation,
picking up additional details as needed...
<p>

</p><hr>

<h3><a name="impl">Finishing our implementation</a></h3>

<h4>A. Getting familiar with the code we've given you</h4>

First, <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse451/09sp/projects/project3light/project3light.tar.gz">download the source
code</a> for our partial implementation.  Untar it and poke around in
the source code to get a general idea of its structure.  The "main()"
function lives in <tt>ext2reader/ext2reader.c</tt>.  The bulk of the
program lives in <tt>ext2reader/ext2access.c</tt>; you'll be adding
code to functions in that file.  The <tt>ext2reader/inc/</tt>
directory contains header files that declare in-memory structures used
by the file system code.
<p>

Second, try compiling the program by cd'ing into <tt>ext2reader/</tt>,
and running "make".
</p><p>

Finally, try running the <tt>ext2reader</tt> program.  You'll need to
pass an argument that is the name of a file containing a valid ext2
file system image.  We've provided such an image for you in
<tt>/cse451/projects/p3light/451_filesystem.ext2</tt> on forkbomb.cs.  So, to
run the program, issue the command:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>$ ./ext2reader /cse451/projects/p3light/451_filesystem.ext2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

Note that the program will print out the results of our test code, and
that the test code assumes you're running the program against the
<tt>451_filesystem.ext2</tt> image.  Because some of the
implementation is missing, the program in its current, unfinished
state fails catastrophically and quits with a floating point
exception.  As you get more of the implementation working, you'll get
further through its execution, and see more of the tests and their
results.  Eventually, when you have your implementation fully working,
it will print out how many total points your implementation has
earned.
</p><p>

The 451_filesystem.ext2 file does contain a mountable file system
image; if you were to write the contents of this file into a raw hard
drive, you'd be able to mount it from your computer.
</p><p>

Even better, if you have root access on a linux machine, you can
actually try this out without having a spare hard drive.  Copy the
file into that linux machine, and you can then use a loopback device
and ask linux to treat the file as though it were a hard drive.  Since
you have root access to the 451 virtual machine used in project 1,
try copying the file into that VM and running the following commands
as root:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>$ mkdir -p /mnt
$ mount -o loop -t ext2 451_filesystem.ext2
$ ls -al /mnt/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>B. Understand read_superblock()</h4>
 
Let's get going with the code.  Begin by opening up the file
<tt>ext2reader/extaccess.c</tt> in your favorite editor.  This file is
where you will be spending the bulk of your time in this project.  The
first function defined in this file is read_superblock(); this
function reads the superblock stored in the first blockgroup of the
disk image into memory, and even better, into a "struct
os_superblock_t" structure.  This structure is defined in
<tt>ext2reader/inc/superblock.h</tt>.<p>

<i>(A programming note: our implementation makes some strong
assumptions about how the compiler lays out C structs in memory.  This
isn't always safe to do, but we've verified that our implementation
works on Linux and Mac OS X on x86 machines.)</i></p><p>

Make sure you understand how and why read_superblock() works.  Note
that this implementation relies on some specific knowledge of the ext2
layout on disk: the first copy of the superblock is in a known
location on disk (byte 1024), and has a known size (<tt>sizeof(struct
os_superblock_t)</tt> bytes).  Scan through superblock.h and get a
feel for the kind of information that is stored in a real superblock.
You'll need to use some of the fields in the superblock structure
later in the project.

</p><h4>C. Finish the implemention of calc_metadata()</h4>

calc_metadata() is a function that uses the data in the superblock to
extract or calculate some key pieces of information about the
file system, and stashes it in a "struct os_fs_metadata_t" structure.
We've provided a bit of the function's implementation for you (one
tricky bit in particular), but the rest is up to you to finish.  The
"struct os_fs_metadata_t" structure is defined in
<tt>ext2reader/inc/ext2access.h</tt>.  <p>

Read through <tt>ext2access.h</tt>, and get a sense of the things
you'll need to extract from the superblock or calculate.  </p><p>

We've provided step-by-step instructions on what you need to do to
finish implementing this function.  As well, our test code will rigorously
confirm that you've gotten everything right, once you have enough
of the function implementation to make it past the floating
point exception.  Finally, we've provided some hints in calc_metadata
in the form of variables that we think you'll want to use along the
way.
</p><p>

So, finish the implementation, compile ext2reader, and try re-running
and fixing it until our tests have verified that calc_metadata() is
correct.  For calibration, our implementation of the parts that are
missing have about 12 lines of code.

</p><p>

<font color="red">A warning:</font> we will be pretty mechanical in
our grading: we'll give you the grades that the test program says you
should get, but we'll deduct points if the compiler generates any
compiler warnings. (Note there are two compiler warnings produced when
you compile the code we've given you; this is because some of the
implementation is still missing.  You should find that you fix these
warnings as a side-effect of working through the project.)  </p><p>

You'll need to write clean code and correct code to get full marks!

</p><h4>D. Implement read_bgdt()</h4>

read_bgdt() will read the blockgroup descriptor table off of disk
into memory, and stash a pointer to the descriptor table in
the metadata structure "fsm" that was previously allocated.
<p>

You'll first need to allocate a single buffer that's big enough to
store all entries in the blockgroup descriptor table, and then read
the entire table from disk into the buffer in one fell swoop.  Doing
this relies on the fact that the on-disk layout of the descriptor
table is the same as the in-memory layout of an array of "struct
os_blockgroup_descriptor_t" structures.  </p><p>

The "struct os_blockgroup_descriptor_t" structure is defined in
<tt>ext2reader/inc/blockgroup_descriptor.h</tt>.
</p><p>

As a hint, our implementation of this function has about 7 lines
of code in total, including some "asserts" that we put in there
as sanity checks.  As before, compile and run ext2reader until
you pass all of our tests for this function.

</p><h4>E. Implement fetch_inode()</h4>

Given an inode number, fetch_inode() should read the associated inode
off of disk into a "struct os_inode_t" structure passed to the
function by the caller.  (Note that the caller passes a pointer to an
already-allocated structure as an argument to fetch_inode(), so you
don't need to malloc anything inside fetch_inode() itself.)
<p>

The hard part in implementing this function is figuring out where the
inode with a given inode number actually lives on disk.  We've provided
a lot of hints on how to figure this out...just follow the steps we've
laid out.  Here's a potential stumbling block you should avoid falling
prey too:  the first inode in the filesystem has inode number 1, not
inode number 0.  (Bleah!)

</p><p>
"struct os_inode_t" is defined in <tt>ext2reader/inc/inode.h</tt>.
You'll want to familiarize yourself with it.
</p><p>

As before, compile and run ext2reader until you pass all of our tests
for this function.  As calibration, our implementation has about 14
lines of code.

</p><h4>F. Finish the implementation of calculate_offsets().</h4>

calculate_offsets() accepts the block number to read from a file,
and figures out whether that block number is accessed through one
of the 12 direct blocks in the inode, or through the single
indirection block, or through the double indirection block, or through
the triple indirection block.  If it should be accessed through
indirection blocks, it figures out the indexes into those blocks to use.
<p>

This code is pretty tricky, but it's useful to get a sense for what
it's doing and what's involved with getting it right.
</p><p>

We've finished most of the implementation of this function, but
have left you one piece: figuring out the appropriate index into
the indirection blocks for very large offsets into a big file that
require using a triple indirection block (and hence also use a double,
and single, indirection block) on the way to the direct block.  Look
for the comment "FINISH THE CODE IN THIS IF CLAUSE" to see where you
need to complete the function.
</p><p>

Getting this last piece right is tricky, but the good news is that if
you can't get it right, the rest of the project will work anyway,
since the file system image we gave you isn't big enough to require a
triple indirection block for any of its files.  (Our test code will
still test that you handle triple indirection blocks correctly,
though!)  </p><p>

As calibration, our implementation of the missing piece has about
6 lines of code.

</p><h4>G. Read through file_blockread()</h4>

file_blockread() will read a block from a given file off of the file
system into memory.  The caller passes in an inode for the file it
wants to read from, and the block offset within that file to read.
For instance, if the blocksize is 1024 bytes, then to read bytes
0-1023 from the file, the caller would pass in block offset 0.  To
read bytes 1024-2047 from the file, the caller would pass in block
offset 1.
<p>
file_blockread() uses the offsets and indexes calculated by
calculated_offsets() to do the actual reading.  The only real
complication is that ext2 supports the notion of "holes" in files:
ranges of a file that logically exists containing zeroes, but which
don't have any physical data blocks allocated to store the zeroes.
</p><p>
Read through the implementation to get a sense of how it works, and
make sure you understand the interface to this function -- i.e.,
how to invoke it, what the arguments mean, and what gets returned
by the function on success or failure.

</p><h4>H. Implement file_read().</h4>

file_read() will read the full contents of a file from disk into
memory.  The caller passes file_read() the inode number of the
file it wants to read, and file_read() will:
<ul>
  <li> convert the inode number into a "struct os_inode_t" using
  fetch_inode(),
  <p>
  
  </p></li><li> allocate space for the full contents of the file,
  <p>

  </p></li><li> loop through the blocks of the file, using file_blockread() to
  read them into memory.
</li></ul>

<p>
As before, compile and run ext2reader until you pass all of our tests
for this function.  As calibration, our implementation has about
22 lines of code.

</p><h4>I. Read through pop_dir_component().</h4>

pop_dir_component() is a utility function that receives an
absolute pathname as an argument, and splits it into two pieces:
the top-most component, and the remaining components.  For example,
it would take a path such as:
<p>
</p><pre>  /foo/bar/baz
</pre>
<p>
and split it into the following two pieces:
</p><p>
</p><pre>  foo

and

  /bar/baz
</pre>
<p>
It allocates space for the top-most component, and returns a pointer
to it through the "next_component" argument.  It updates the path in
place to re-write it to be the remaining components (i.e., converts
/foo/bar/baz into /bar/baz in place).
</p><p>
You'll make use of this function in your implementation of scan_dir,
so make sure you understand how it works.  Reading the test code
for this function (in <tt>testcode.c</tt>'s check_pop_dir_component())
is a good way to confirm your understanding is correct.

</p><h4>J. Implement scan_dir()</h4>

Given the contents of a directory file, the length of the directory
file, and a file name, this function scans through the directory file
looking for a directory entry that matches the file name.  If it finds
one, it returns the inode number for that file name.  If it doesn't,
it returns 0.
<p>
You'll need to understand some details about the linked list structure
of directory entries within a directory file to implement this
function correctly.  We've provided enough information in part
A of this web page, as well as in the comments inside scan_dir()
itself.
</p><p>
As before, compile and run ext2reader until you pass all of our
tests for this function.  As calibration, our implementation has
about 15-20 lines of code.
</p><p>
You're almost done now...

</p><h4>K. Read through ls_dir()</h4>

ls_dir is similar to scan_dir(), except it produces a listing
of all of the files contained within a directory.

<h4>L. Read through path_read()</h4>

Path read is the culmination of this project:  given a
string containing an absolute path name (e.g., "/foo/bar/baz"),
this function will walk down the directory hierarchy using
scan_dir() and pop_dir_component(), and then read the contents
of the leaf of the path name into memory, returning this to the
caller.
<p>
If you want a challenge, delete our implementation of path_read(),
and figure out how to implement it yourself...this is strictly
optional, of course!
</p><p>

</p><hr>

<h3><a name="turn">What to turn in</a></h3>

Create a README.TXT file in the <tt>ext2reader/</tt>
with the names of your project team members.
<p>
Then, create .tar.gz file containing the completed
<tt>ext2reader/</tt> directory; for example, run the
following command to create the .tar.gz file:
</p><blockquote>
<pre>$ tar -cvzf ext2reader.tar.gz ./ext2reader/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

Use the turnin program on attu.cs to turn in your ext2reader.tar.gz
file, under the project name "project3light".
</p><p>

As a reminder, we will be mechanical about our grading for this
assignment.  We'll go primarily by how may test code points your code
accumulates, but we will deduct points for any compiler warnings that
are emitted during compilation.  (If your code doesn't compile and
run, you might not earn any points at all!!)
